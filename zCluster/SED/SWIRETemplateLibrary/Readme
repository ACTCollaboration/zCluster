The SWIRE template library
--------------------------


The SWIRE template library contains 25 templates including 3 ellipticals, 7
spirals, 6 starbursts, 7 AGNs (3 type 1 AGNs, 4 type 2 AGNs), and 2
composite (starburst+AGN) templates covering the wavelength range between
1000 Angstrom and 1000 micron. The elliptical, spiral and starburst
templates, were generated with the GRASIL code (Silva et al. 1998). The 7
spirals range from early to late types (S0-Sdm), the starburst templates
correspond to the SEDs of NGC 6090, NGC 6240, M 82, Arp 220, IRAS
22491-1808, and IRAS 20551-4250.  In all of the spirals and starburst
templates the spectral region between 5 and 12 micron, where many broad
emission and absorption features are observed, was replaced using observed
IR spectra from the PHT-S spectrometer on the Infrared space Observatory and
from IRS on Spitzer.

Templates of moderately luminous AGN, representing Seyfert 1.8 and Seyfert 2
galaxies, were obtained by combining models, broad-band photometric data
(NED), and ISO-PHT-S spectra (Schulz, private communication) of a random
sample of 28 Seyfert galaxies. The other six AGN templates include three
templates representing optically-selected QSOs with different values of
infrared/optical flux ratios (QSO1, TQSO1, and BQSO1) and two type 2 QSO
(QSO2 and Torus). The QSO1 templates are derived by combining the SDSS
quasar composite spectrum and rest-frame infrared data of a sample of 35
SDSS/SWIRE (Hatziminaoglou et al. 2005). After normalizing each SED in the
optical, we derived three templates with the same optical spectrum but three
different IR SEDs. The QSO1 IR template was obtained from the average fluxes
of all the measurements regrouped in wavelength bins, the TQSO1 IR template
was obtained from the highest 25% measurements per bin, and the BQSO1 IR
template was obtained from the lowest 25% measurements per bin. The type 2
QSO template (QSO2) was obtained by combining the observed optical/near-IR
spectrum of the red quasar FIRST J013435.7-093102 (Gregg et al. 2002) and
the rest-frame IR data from the quasars in the Palomar-Green sample with
consistent optical SEDs. The other type 2 QSO template (Torus) corresponds
to the model used to fit the SED of a heavily obscured type 2 QSO,
SWIRE_J104409.95+585224.8 (Polletta et al. 2006).

The composite (AGN+SB) templates are empirical templates created to fit the
SEDs of the following objects: the heavily obscured BAL QSO Mrk 231 (Berta
2005, Ph.D. Thesis), the Seyfert 2 galaxy IRAS 19254-7245 South (Berta et
al. 2003). These objects contain a powerful starburst component, mainly
responsible for their large infrared luminosities and an AGN component that
contributes to the mid-IR luminosities.

The SWIRE template library has been used in the following works: Polletta et
al. 2005, ApJ submitted, Tajer et al. A&A, submitted, Siana et al. 2007, ApJ
submitted, Polletta et al. 2006, Weedman et al. 2006, Davoodi et al. 2006a,
2006b, Jarrett et al. 2006, Hatziminaoglou et al. 2005, Franceschini et al.
2005, Lonsdale et al. 2004. 

For each template a file with 2 columns is given (1st col.: wavelength in
Angstrom, 2nd col: normalized at 5500 Angstrom F_lambda in erg cm-2 s-1
A-1). A description of each template is given below.
